# Python Generators Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates advanced usage of **Python generators** to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations.

The project covers:

- Creating generators for iterative data processing.
- Handling large datasets with batch processing and lazy loading.
- Simulating pagination and streaming data.
- Computing aggregate functions like averages using generators.
- Integrating Python with a MySQL database.

## Project Setup

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed (tested with Python 3.12).  
2. Install and configure MySQL server on your machine.  
3. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shantralee-58/alx-backend-python.git
cd alx-backend-python/python-generators-0x00
